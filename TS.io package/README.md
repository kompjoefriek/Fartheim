I can't be any clearer what this mod is about. It's about farts.

You fart. Mobs fart. Birds fart. You can fart on demand by crouching. Farts blow in the wind.

All the farts.

## Not my code
This is a fork of https://github.com/Pfhoenix/Fartheim with only minor changes to get it to work with the latest version of Valheim (Ashlands)
